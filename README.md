# Pagila

The purpose of this project is to better understand the customer behavior, film performance, and store effincy of Pagila [1], a fictional DVD rental chain. Through this analysis, I hope to provide suggestions to boost revenue and reduce churn.

# SQL 

Using PostgreSQL [2], we are interested in identifying some key business analytics. The data pulled from the various queries will be taken into Python [3] in the next section for deeper insights. The next three subsections outline what the main three categories we are interested in:

## Revenue and Trends
- Which film categories generate the most revenue overall
- Which categories are growing/shrinking month over month

## Customer Insights
- Who are the top 10 customer by lifetime spending
- How many customer join per month
- Which is the churn of customers (no rentals within the last 3 months)

## Store Performance
- Which store generates more revenue
- Which manager oversees the best-performing store
- Which cities/countries drive the most business
